# BMAD Builder Inputs — How to Use These Artifacts

This folder contains markdown inputs intended for the BMAD Builder Module (`_bmad/bmb`) to generate agents and workflows.

## Recommended Build Sequence
1. **Team Blueprint**
   - `team_overview.md`
2. **Product Definition**
   - `PRD.md`
3. **System Design**
   - `Architecture.md`
4. **Execution Plan**
   - `TODO.md`
5. **Agent Specs**
   - `agents/*.md`

## Notes
- This project is research-only and local execution only (no UI).
- Forecast outputs must include:
  - ranked pool list, and
  - ranked candidate 5-part sets.
