# C5 - PartPulse Research Collective Module

Specialized agents for multi-location parts demand forecasting research. This team builds ML pipelines to predict next-day California manufacturing parts requirements using historical multi-state demand patterns.

## Overview

The C5 module provides a complete research team for time-series forecasting with two complementary outputs:
- **Ranked Pool**: Probability-ranked list of parts likely needed tomorrow
- **Ranked Sets**: Multiple candidate 5-part combinations for location assignments

**7 Specialized Agents** | **Research-Only** | **Local Execution**
